            <h2>What is Named Entity Recognition (NER)?</h2>
            <p>Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique that identifies and categorizes specific entities within a text. These entities may include names of people, organizations, locations, dates, and other predefined categories. NER is essential in extracting meaningful information from unstructured text data.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>How NER Works</h2>
            <p>NER uses pre-trained language models, such as those available in <strong>SpaCy</strong>, to analyze text and identify entities. The model processes the text in several steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Tokenization:</strong> The text is split into smaller units called tokens, typically words or punctuation marks.</li>
                <li><strong>Part-of-Speech Tagging:</strong> Each token is labeled with its grammatical role, such as noun, verb, or adjective.</li>
                <li><strong>Entity Recognition:</strong> Using context and linguistic patterns, the model identifies named entities and assigns them to categories such as <em>PERSON</em>, <em>ORG</em>, or <em>GPE</em> (geopolitical entity).</li>
            </ol>
        </section>

            <h2>NER in Document Classification</h2>
            <p>Document classification involves categorizing documents based on their content. NER enhances this process by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Extracting Key Information:</strong> Identifying entities that are relevant to specific categories.</li>
                <li><strong>Reducing Noise:</strong> Filtering out irrelevant text and focusing on meaningful data.</li>
                <li><strong>Improving Accuracy:</strong> Using extracted entities as features for classification models.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For example, in a legal document classification task, NER can extract entities like case numbers, dates, and parties involved, which can help determine the document's category.</p>

            <h2>Tools Used in This Application</h2>
            <p>This application utilizes the <strong>SpaCy</strong> library, specifically its pre-trained <em>en_core_web_sm</em> model, for NER tasks. Additionally, tools like PyPDF2 and python-docx are used to extract text from documents before applying NER.</p>
